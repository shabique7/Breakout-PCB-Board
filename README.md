#FT232RL USB to Serial Breakout Board

ðŸ“œ Overview
This schematic shows a USB to UART/Serial Breakout Board using the FT232RL chip. It enables communication between a USB host (such as a PC) and a microcontroller or other UART-compatible device.
The design includes essential components like status LEDs, filtering capacitors, and USB connection headers for reliable operation.

ðŸ§©Key Components

ðŸŸ©U1: FT232RL-REEL
- Core USB-to-Serial converter IC  
- Converts USB signals (D+/Dâˆ’) to UART signals (TX, RX)  
- Provides control lines such as DTR, RTS, CTS, etc.  
- Powered from +5V with a 3.3V output available at pin 17 (3V3OUT)  
- Ground pins tied together for stability

ðŸŸ¥U2: B06B-PSILE-1(LF)(SN)
- 6-pin UART interface connector  
- Pinout: GND, VCC, RXD, TXD, CTS, DTR  
- Allows easy connection to external microcontrollers or serial devices

ðŸŸ¡USB Connector: KH-MINI-SMT-5P-CU
- Micro USB-B type connector  
- Interfaces directly with the USB host  
- Provides USB D+, Dâˆ’ lines, +5V supply, and GND

ðŸŸ  LEDs and Resistors
- LED1 (TXLED) and LED2 (RXLED) indicate UART activity  
- Driven via CBUS0 and CBUS1 pins of the FT232RL  
- R1 and R2:1kÎ© current-limiting resistors  
- R3:10kÎ© pull-down resistor on USB D+ line (optional, improves reliability)

ðŸ”µCapacitors
- C1:0.1ÂµF decoupling capacitor for +3.3V line  
- C2,C3:0.1ÂµF decoupling capacitors for +5V line  
- Filter power supply noise to ensure stable operation


ðŸ“¶Signal Flow
1. USB signals enter from the USB micro connector (KH-MINI-SMT-5P-CU).  
2. FT232RL converts these USB signals to UART (TXD/RXD).  
3. UART signals are routed to the 6-pin UART header (U2) for external connections.  
4. Status LEDs display data transmission activity (TX/RX).


âœ…Features
- USB to TTL Serial conversion using FT232RL  
- Onboard TX and RX activity LEDs for easy debugging  
- 3.3V output available for powering external devices  
- Clean power supply decoupling with 0.1ÂµF capacitors  
- Compatible with most USB hosts and microcontrollers
